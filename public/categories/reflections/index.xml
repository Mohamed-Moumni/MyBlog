      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-i-dont-watch-football-anymore&#34;&gt;Why i don&amp;rsquo;t watch football anymore&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong i’ve been a football fan since I was 6 years old. I started by watching matches from our local league in morocco as well as games of our national team. I was obsessed with the sport: team histories, player’s names, and famous figures in the league.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I got older, I began following international leagues such as la liga in spain and the Premier league in UK, along with major international competitions like the world cup and the African Cup.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think about this subject every now and then, usually when i realize how much time i&amp;rsquo;ve been spending on social media. I keep asking myself why i can&amp;rsquo;t stop chekcing those apps. it feels like i&amp;rsquo;m missing something important, but in reality it&amp;rsquo;s just my brain craving a quick dopamine hit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve deleted my facebook and instagram accounts multiple times, only to return again. it&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to cut myself off completely. Every time i try, it feels like i&amp;rsquo;m disconnecting from what&amp;rsquo;s happening in the world, especially in my field &amp;ndash; software engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
