      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-i-dont-watch-football-anymore&#34;&gt;Why i don&amp;rsquo;t watch football anymore&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong i’ve been a football fan since I was 6 years old. I started by watching matches from our local league in morocco as well as games of our national team. I was obsessed with the sport: team histories, player’s names, and famous figures in the league.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I got older, I began following international leagues such as la liga in spain and the Premier league in UK, along with major international competitions like the world cup and the African Cup.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
