I keep asking myself why i can&amp;rsquo;t stop chekcing those apps. it feels like i&amp;rsquo;m missing something important, but in reality it&amp;rsquo;s just my brain craving a quick dopamine hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve deleted my facebook and instagram accounts multiple times, only to return again. it&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to cut myself off completely. Every time i try, it feels like i&amp;rsquo;m disconnecting from what&amp;rsquo;s happening in the world, especially in my field &amp;ndash; software engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>what I learned from the reimplementation of ping command in C</title><link>https://mmoumni.com/posts/reimplementation-ping-command-in-c/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mmoumni.com/posts/reimplementation-ping-command-in-c/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve always struggled to fully grasp the networking side of software development — especially when it comes to network programming concepts like sockets, binding, TCP/IP, and protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I decided to take on the challenge and fill in the gaps in my understanding. To do that, I chose to reimplement three well-known networking commands: &lt;code&gt;ping&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;traceroute&lt;/code&gt;, and a simplified version of &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this series of articles, I’ll explain each command in detail — its use case and how it works under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
