## Overview

Cube3D is a classic 42 school project that challenges you to build a 3D game engine using raycasting—a rendering technique that creates a 3D perspective from a 2D map. It's an excellent way to understand how early 3D games worked and how graphics rendering algorithms function.

## Features

- Raycasting engine implementation
- 2D map to 3D perspective conversion
- Real-time rendering
- Player movement and camera controls
- Texture mapping
- Sprite rendering

## Technologies Used

- **C** - Core implementation language
- **MinilibX** - Graphics library (42's minimal X11 interface)
- **Raycasting Algorithms** - 3D rendering technique
- **Mathematics** - Vector math, trigonometry for raycasting
