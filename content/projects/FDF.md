# FDF (Fil de Fer)

FDF, which stands for "Fil de Fer" (Wireframe in French), is a 3D wireframe renderer that takes height map data and renders it as a 3D wireframe visualization. This project explores 3D graphics programming, coordinate transformations, and mathematical projections.

## Overview

FDF is a 42 school project that teaches the fundamentals of 3D graphics by building a wireframe renderer from scratch. It takes a file containing height map data and renders it as a 3D wireframe model that can be rotated, scaled, and viewed from different angles.

## Features

- 3D wireframe rendering
- Height map parsing
- Isometric and perspective projections
- Camera rotation and zoom
- Color gradients based on height
- Real-time rendering

## Technologies Used

- **C** - Core implementation language
- **MinilibX** - Graphics library (42's minimal X11 interface)
- **Linear Algebra** - Matrix transformations, 3D rotations
- **Projection Mathematics** - Converting 3D coordinates to 2D screen space
