# HTTP WebServer

This project is about writing an HTTP server from scratch and learning about how the HTTP protocol works around the web. It's a hands-on exploration of web server architecture, request handling, and protocol implementation.

## Overview

Building an HTTP server from the ground up provides deep insights into how web applications communicate, how requests are parsed, and how responses are constructed and sent back to clients.

## Features

- HTTP request parsing
- HTTP response generation
- Static file serving
- Support for multiple HTTP methods
- Modular server architecture

## Technologies Used

- **C++** - Core implementation language
- **HTML/CSS** - Web content
- **Socket Programming** - Network communication
- **Make** - Build system
