I’ve always struggled to fully grasp the networking side of software development — especially when it comes to network programming concepts like sockets, binding, TCP/IP, and protocols.

So, I decided to take on the challenge and fill in the gaps in my understanding. To do that, I chose to reimplement three well-known networking commands: `ping`, `traceroute`, and a simplified version of `nmap`.

**Prerequisites**

To get the most out of this article, you should have a basic understanding of the following concepts:

- The **OSI model**
- **General programming knowledge** (preferably in **C**)
- What a **network** is and the basics of **IP addresses**

### What the ping command is used For?

As defined by Wikipedia, **ping** is a computer network administration utility used to test the reachability of a host on a network. It’s commonly used by system administrators, DevOps engineers, and developers to verify whether a specific host is reachable over the network.

### How Ping Really works under the hood

---

The logic behind the `ping` command is based on the **ICMP protocol** — short for **Internet Control Message Protocol**.

While Wikipedia defines ICMP as a supporting protocol in the Internet protocol suite used by network devices (like routers) to send error messages and operational information, let’s skip the textbook definition and get practical.

ICMP operates at the **Network Layer** of the OSI model (alongside IP). It’s used to report errors and test connectivity between devices.

When using `ping`, ICMP packets are crafted and sent over the network. Each ICMP packet consists of an **IP header**, followed by an **ICMP message**, which itself has a header and a payload.

Here’s a breakdown of the **ICMP header** used in `ping`:

- **Type**: Identifies the type of ICMP message. `ping` uses **Echo Request (type 8)** and **Echo Reply (type 0)**.
- **Code**: A subtype for the ICMP message. For Echo Request and Reply, the code is usually 0.
- **Checksum**: Used for error checking. It’s computed over the ICMP header and payload, with the checksum field initially set to zero. [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1071.html](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1071.html)
- **Identifier**: Uniquely identifies the `ping` process. It helps distinguish between multiple running instances.
- **Sequence Number**: Increments with each packet to track which Echo Request each Echo Reply corresponds to.
- **Payload**: Arbitrary data included with the packet.

The `ping` command works by sending ICMP packets one after another, but let’s focus on the workflow of sending just **one packet** to understand how it operates behind the scenes.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown: Sending One ICMP Packet

1. **Construct the ICMP Echo Request**
    
    The host prepares the ICMP header with the following fields:
    
    - **Type**: `8` — This indicates an *Echo Request*, used to tell the target host “I’m sending an ICMP request.”
    - **Code**: `0` — Standard for Echo Request messages.
    - **Checksum**: A value calculated over the entire ICMP packet (header + payload) for error detection.
    - **Identifier**: Typically set using the **PID (Process ID)** of the running `ping` process to help identify replies.
    - **Sequence Number**: Usually starts at `0` and increments with each new packet. It helps match replies to their requests.
    - **Payload (Data)**: Commonly includes the result of the `gettimeofday()` function — in other words, the current timestamp. This is later used to measure the **round-trip time (RTT)**.

The **IP header** isn’t something we usually need to worry about when implementing `ping` in user space. It’s handled automatically by the **Operating System**.

That means fields like the **source IP address**, **destination IP address**, **TTL**, and others are added by the OS when the packet is sent.

As developers, we only need to construct the **ICMP header and payload**. The OS takes care of wrapping it in the proper IP packet and sending it out through the network.


After the target server receives the Echo Request packet, it responds with an **ICMP Echo Reply**. This reply includes an ICMP header with slightly different values than the one we originally sent.

Here are the key attributes in the received ICMP reply:

- **Type**: `0` — This indicates an *Echo Reply*.
- **Code**: `0`
- **Identifier (ID)**: Same as the one sent in the request (used to match replies with requests).
- **Sequence Number**: Also matches the request, helping us track which reply corresponds to which packet.
- **Payload**: The same data we originally sent (usually the timestamp from `gettimeofday()`).

![image.png](/images/Reimplementation-of-the-Ping-Command/image%204.png)

Once we receive the reply, we can construct the output that the `ping` command typically shows.

- The **ID** and **Sequence Number** are taken directly from the ICMP reply.
- The **TTL (Time To Live)** is extracted from the **IP header** — which, remember, is handled by the OS.
- The **RTT (Round-Trip Time)** is calculated by subtracting the timestamp in the payload (the time the packet was sent) from the current time (the time it was received).

This gives us everything we need to display a line like:

### How to implement the command step by step

---

So now that we understand how the `ping` command works at a high level, let’s **dive into the actual implementation**.

You can break the program into **four main parts**:

1. **Argument Parsing**
2. **Socket Setup**
3. **Ping Loop**
4. **Ping Output / Statistics**

---

### 1. Argument Parsing

In this part, I handle the input arguments passed to the program.

It’s the simplest part of the project — especially if you’re already familiar with basic CLI programming.

I just parse the hostname and optional flags (like `-v` or `-c`) and perform some basic error checking to make sure the input is valid. Nothing fancy here, but necessary to ensure robustness.

---

### 2. Socket Setup

This is where things get more interesting.

- First, I resolve the hostname provided by the user into an IP address using the `getaddrinfo()` function. This allows the program to work with both domain names and direct IPs.
- Then, I create a **RAW socket**, which is different from a regular TCP or UDP socket.
    
    A RAW socket gives you lower-level access to the network, allowing you to bypass the transport layer and work directly with protocols like ICMP.
    
    > (If you're not sure about the difference between a regular and RAW socket, it's worth looking up — RAW sockets are powerful but also require root privileges.)
    >

### 3. Ping Loop

Here, I set up an **infinite loop** to:

- Send an ICMP Echo Request
- Wait for the Echo Reply

To send packets at regular intervals, I use the `alarm()` function in combination with the `SIGALRM` signal.

Each second, `SIGALRM` is triggered, and I use that moment to:

- Send the packet using `sendto()`
- Listen for a reply using `recvfrom()`

When a reply is received, I extract the ICMP header and payload, and perform calculations like RTT and TTL.

---

### 4. Ping Output

Finally, after the loop ends (e.g., after a Ctrl+C or count limit), I print the ping statistics.

This includes:

- Number of packets sent and received
- Packet loss percentage
- Minimum, maximum, and average **RTT**
- The **TTL** from the last packet

It mirrors the standard output you’d see in the real `ping` command.

---

### Conclusion

Reimplementing the `ping` command is a great exercise to deepen your understanding of **network programming**, **low-level socket APIs**, and how protocols like **ICMP** work under the hood.

Throughout this walkthrough, we explored how `ping` operates — from constructing and sending ICMP Echo Request packets, to receiving replies, calculating RTT, and displaying meaningful statistics. We broke the program into four core components: argument parsing, socket setup, the ping loop, and final output.

By handling raw sockets and crafting protocol-specific packets, you get a practical view of what’s normally abstracted away by higher-level APIs. This not only demystifies tools like `ping`, but also strengthens your grasp of the OSI model, IP communication, and signal handling in C.
