I think about this subject every now and then, usually when i realize how much time i've been spending on social media. I keep asking myself why i can't stop chekcing those apps. it feels like i'm missing something important, but in reality it's just my brain craving a quick dopamine hit.

I've deleted my facebook and instagram accounts multiple times, only to return again. it's hard for me to cut myself off completely. Every time i try, it feels like i'm disconnecting from what's happening in the world, especially in my field -- software engineering.

I've read articles, books, and watched documentries about this dilemma. The facts and the damage are shocking. Social media affects our attention span, our emotions and in extrem cases, can contribute to depression and even thoughts of suicide.

The ironic part is that we trade the most precious thing we have which is our time for cheap dopmaine hits or meaningless updtes from influncers. Meanwhile, we could use that time for something that actually matters: a hobyy, reading, learning something new, spending time with family, or simply sitting quitely and doing nothing would be more beneficial instead.

I'm writing these thoughts to remind myself of the choices i'm making with my life. should i sell my time cheaply or choose to invest it in something vauluable ?

Choose wisely.
