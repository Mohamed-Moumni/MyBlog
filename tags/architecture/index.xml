&lt;p&gt;In the previous article, I discussed the high-level architecture of the entire application. In this article, I will focus on the scraper service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="system-design"&gt;System Design:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid distracting myself with too many actions that the scraper API could support, I chose to start small and extend it as needs arise.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Building the BotolaPro Fantasy App Part1: Scrapping the Base Data</title><link>https://mmoumni.com/posts/building-the-botolapro-fantasy-app-part1-scrapping-the-base-data/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mmoumni.com/posts/building-the-botolapro-fantasy-app-part1-scrapping-the-base-data/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="building-the-botolapro-fantasy-app-part1-scrapping-the-base-data"&gt;Building the BotolaPro Fantasy App Part1: Scrapping the Base Data&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are following my previous blogs, you may have noticed that i wrote a blog post about why i stopped watching football. You might be thinking: what is this guy doing? He Said he stopped watching football, and now he’s trying to build football game. Let me clarify why i’m doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main Goal is to learn about mobile application development. While exploring ideas, I realized that there is no fantasy app for the Moroccan Botola Pro League. I thought this could be a good exercise to apply the skills I will learn during my mobile development journey, and it also seemed quite challenging.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
