I’ve observed several emerging patterns among new software engineers. Although i’m still a junior, I definitely see myself as part of that group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New coming engineers are heavily relying on AI tools; however, they haven’t spent enough time building things that would give them the experience and knowledge needed to use those tools with real confidence. I’m referring to the core fundamentals of software engineering not frameworks or technologies that shift every few months.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>what I learned from the reimplementation of ping command in C</title><link>https://mmoumni.com/posts/reimplementation-ping-command-in-c/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mmoumni.com/posts/reimplementation-ping-command-in-c/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve always struggled to fully grasp the networking side of software development — especially when it comes to network programming concepts like sockets, binding, TCP/IP, and protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I decided to take on the challenge and fill in the gaps in my understanding. To do that, I chose to reimplement three well-known networking commands: &lt;code&gt;ping&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;traceroute&lt;/code&gt;, and a simplified version of &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this series of articles, I’ll explain each command in detail — its use case and how it works under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
